# Scam Reporter Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview
Your scam-reporter application is now successfully configured to save submitted scam reports to the database. After deleting the fraudguard and fraudguarddb databases, we've set up a dedicated `scam_reporter_db` database for your application.

## What Was Configured

### 1. Database Configuration
- **Database Name**: `scam_reporter_db` (MongoDB)
- **Connection String**: `mongodb://localhost:27017/scam_reporter_db`
- **Port**: Changed from 5000 to 5001 to avoid conflicts

### 2. Model Updates
- **ScamReport Model**: Updated to allow anonymous reports (reportedBy field is now optional)
- **Scam Types**: Aligned API validation with model enum values:
  - `online_shopping`
  - `investment`
  - `romance`
  - `phishing`
  - `fake_job`
  - `crypto`
  - `tech_support`
  - `charity`
  - `lottery`
  - `rental`
  - `identity_theft`
  - `other`

### 3. API Endpoints
All endpoints are working correctly:
- âœ… `POST /api/scams` - Submit new scam reports
- âœ… `GET /api/scams` - List approved scam reports (with pagination and filtering)
- âœ… `GET /api/scams/:id` - Get single scam report
- âœ… `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

## Testing Results
- âœ… Database connection successful
- âœ… Scam report creation working
- âœ… Data persistence verified
- âœ… API endpoints functional
- âœ… Validation working correctly

## How to Use

### Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```
Server will run on: `http://localhost:5001`

### Submit a Scam Report (Example)
```javascript
POST http://localhost:5001/api/scams
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Fake Online Store Scam",
  "description": "Detailed description of the scam...",
  "scamType": "online_shopping",
  "dateOccurred": "2024-01-20",
  "scammerName": "Scammer Name",
  "scammerEmail": "scammer@example.com",

  "amountLost": "1200",
  "contactInfo": "reporter@example.com"
}
```

### List Scam Reports
```bash
GET http://localhost:5001/api/scams?page=1&limit=10
```

## File Structure
```
backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/ScamReport.js     # Updated scam report model
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/scams.js          # API routes for scam reports
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js                # Main server file
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                     # Environment configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json             # Dependencies
â””â”€â”€ uploads/                 # File upload directory
```

## Important Notes

1. **Anonymous Reports**: The system now supports anonymous scam reports (no user authentication required)

2. **Report Status**: New reports are created with `pending` status and need to be approved to be publicly visible

3. **File Uploads**: The system supports evidence file uploads (screenshots, documents, etc.)

4. **Search & Filtering**: Reports can be searched and filtered by scam type, date, etc.

5. **Moderation**: Admin users can approve, reject, or modify reports

## Utility Scripts Created

### Test Database Connection
```bash
node test-scam-save.js
```

### Test API Endpoints
```bash
node test-api.js
```

### Approve Pending Reports
```bash
node approve-reports.js

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Connect your frontend application to these API endpoints
2. **User Authentication**: Implement user registration/login if needed
3. **Admin Panel**: Create an admin interface for report moderation
4. **Email Notifications**: Set up notifications for new reports
5. **Analytics**: Add reporting and analytics features
